#### Intro
My name is Pascal BÃ¶hler and I am a student and artist currently living in Frankfurt am Main, Hessen, Germany. In my free time I am working on different art projects in the field of photography in addition to some coding projects here on GitHub, trying to create tools that help me in my day to day life.

For the future, I want to collaborate more with different people around the globe. Also, I want to further start to find creative applications for code in the art field and especially in photography, that make the lifes of other creatives easier.

In the past, I took part in two hackathons by JugendHackt, working on projects about. Also, I created many smaller coding projects you can find on my GitHub account, mostly to further experiment with different concepts and techniques.

Currently, I am working a lot with Python and CPP. Python I use to work with datasets and when trying to quickly create a function for physics class, to plot data or similiar. With C++ I work with OpenFrameworks and the Arduino platform, to create creative ideas I have. Also I use C++ whenever it needs to be really fast.
